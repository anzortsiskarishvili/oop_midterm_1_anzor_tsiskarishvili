## Overview
This repository contains the solution to Midterm 1. The objective of this project was to implement [brief description of what the project is about, e.g., a Bus Ticket Booking System, Library Management System, etc.].

## 1. Challenges Faced and Resolutions

### a) Understanding New Java Constructs:
One of the challenges I faced was understanding the use of [specific Java constructs, e.g., collections like `ArrayList`, managing data with classes and objects, exception handling, etc.]. At first, it was a bit overwhelming as I was unfamiliar with how to structure the code properly for [specific feature]. 

**Resolution**: I broke down the tasks into smaller steps, focusing on individual features one at a time. I wrote small test programs to experiment with new concepts before incorporating them into the final project.

### b) Debugging Complex Logic:
Another challenge was debugging the logic of [specific functionality, e.g., ticket booking, or handling dynamic data]. Some features were not behaving as expected, and pinpointing where things went wrong was difficult.

**Resolution**: I used print statements and basic debugging techniques to trace through the code and figure out the exact points of failure. I also made sure to handle edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, out-of-range errors) to improve the reliability of the system.

## 2. AI Tools and Their Usefulness

### a) How AI Helped Me Learn New Java Constructs:
AI tools, especially [ChatGPT or any other AI tools you used], were immensely helpful in understanding Java constructs that were new to me in this exam. Specifically, AI helped me:

- **ArrayList**: I was initially confused about how to use `ArrayList` to dynamically store and manage collections. AI provided examples and explained how `ArrayList` methods work, such as `add()`, `remove()`, and `size()`.
  
- **Exception Handling**: AI also helped me understand how to implement `try-catch` blocks for handling exceptions, especially in situations where user inputs might be invalid.

**Tasks Completed Using AI**:
- Understanding the correct syntax and usage of `ArrayList` in Java.
- Writing exception handling code to catch errors when inputs are invalid.
- Clarifying how to organize Java classes to handle the main functionality of the program.

### b) Overall Experience with AI Tools:
AI was very helpful, especially for understanding the syntax and offering explanations for concepts that I struggled to grasp. It saved a lot of time in researching and clarified tricky parts of the project, allowing me to focus more on building the application.

## 3. Cases Where AI Was Not as Useful

### a) Complex Logic for Ticket Booking:
Although AI was very useful for basic syntax and concepts, it wasn’t as effective in solving specific business logic issues. For example, when implementing the ticket booking system, AI couldn’t provide a solution tailored to the exact problem I was facing with [specific part of the system, e.g., managing available ticket quantities or handling concurrent bookings].

**Outcome**: I had to rely on research and manual debugging for these more complex aspects of the project. AI wasn't able to guide me through the specific nuances of my code, but I used it for general advice and conceptual understanding.

### b) User Interface (UI) Design:
AI also couldn’t provide detailed suggestions for UI/UX design, which I had to develop on my own. Since my project didn’t focus on UI, I didn't use AI much for this, but when I needed it, it was less effective in providing concrete solutions.

**Outcome**: For the design aspects, I had to rely on my knowledge and external resources (e.g., tutorials or design guidelines).

## Conclusion

AI tools proved to be extremely useful for understanding Java syntax, constructs, and general programming practices, especially in areas that were unfamiliar to me. However, for more complex logic and design decisions specific to my project, AI wasn't always sufficient, and I had to rely on my own problem-solving skills.
